      <p align="left">05-21 Same day! Now the Ukrainian border. Have to pay again 
        because I don't have the exit stamp from Moldova. It's not even their 
        country but they insist. OK here is the $10 again. </p>
      <p align="left">The train comes into Odessa station. Looot of people on 
        the platform. It's a stampede. They rush into the train by the 4 doors 
        and windows. They want a seat. We are still inside. WOW! Finally I go 
        through all these people with my bike. Re-enter again to get my bags. 
        Lost nothing. Nothing broken. My first impression of the country is not 
        that good. Cycle to the &quot;Passazh&quot;. Odessa's best budget hotel 
        which was once it's grandest. The inside is a bit shabby but the structure 
        is grandiose. Lot of marble and columns. $10/night (but no hot water)</p>
      <p align="left">It's only 1 o'clock. I walk 10 min. I'm in front of the 
        Opera &amp; Ballet Theater. Yeh! ballet tomorrow. Ticket : $2 incredible. 
        The city is really nice and warm. Walk along the boulevards and seaport. 
        Have dinner at &quot;Fidel-Havana Club&quot;. It's like the best outside 
        cafe on &quot;Les Champs Elisee&quot;. The food is really good. But you 
        come here not only to feed your stomach. But to feed your eyes. The street 
        is closed to traffic. It's for watching people. I would say &quot;women&quot;. 
        It's &quot;La Riviera&quot; or &quot;Hollywood&quot; for the Russian elite.</p>
      <p align="left">I'm going to stay a few days. Did some shopping. Vodka, 
        caviar. It's cheap. WHAT A DAY!</p>
      <p align="left">05-22 They have an Internet cafe in the hotel. Wow! Big 
        flat screens and the best speed I've seen in Europe up to now. Have to 
        go to the ballet. It's at noon.... I'm very lucky for the shows. The ballet 
        is <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Ukraine/nutcracker.html">Chaykovskiy's 
        Shchelkunchik</a>. Hum! In English &quot;Nutcracker&quot;. Right after 
        I go to the beach. 30 min by bus to <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Ukraine/arcadia.html">Arcadia</a>. 
        Crowded. The water is clean. Back to Odessa. Not as many people as yesterday 
        strolling on the streets. Have dinner at the restaurant next to Fidel 
        : McDonald. They have a terrace as well.</p>
      <p align="left">05-23 Bureaucracy! Took me 5 hours and two trips to the 
        train station to get a ticket for tomorrow. The lady at the ticket window 
        was making 2 or 3 tickets and taking a 10 min brake every time. At the 
        information window the other lady answered me with a loud &quot;niet&quot; 
        when I asked if she spoke English. And for every question you much pay 
        some money. I saw the three persons in front of me paying. And it's the 
        same at other information counters across Ukraine. Wow! Another racket! 
        I hope it's not going to be like that in every communist country. But 
        I found a nice person to help me when it came time to ask for my special 
        piece of luggage : the bike. So going to Simferopol. From there I'll start 
        cycling around Ukraine.</p>
      <p align="left">05-24 Waiting for the train. No special wagon for luggage. 
        When there is no such car you can take your bike inside for an arbitrary 
        fee set by the coach conductor. I hate that. Another racket. So removed 
        the wheels to fit the bike in the overhead compartment beside my couchette</p>
      <p align="left">05-25 21 hrs of train. Long but not so bad. Staying here 
        (Simferopol) for the night. Will start early tomorrow. Direction : a beach 
        near Sevastopol.</p>
      <p align="left">05-26 My best day ever. 112.5 Km for a total of 1202 km. 
        Started a 7:00AM and stopped around 6:00 PM . Sevastopol : nothing to 
        see. Not even worth a picture. So down to the <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Ukraine/crimea.html">coast</a> 
        where I camp. My first swim into the Black Sea. The <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Ukraine/jelly.html">water</a> 
        is crystal clear. So, why Black Sea?</p>
      <p align="left">05-27 My toughest day ever. Same hours as yesterday but 
        only 65.3 km . Sometimes 2 km in one hour. I was walking and pushing the 
        bike. 100m and resting 2 minutes. Sometimes 55 km/hr downhill on the brakes. 
        Dangerous. Too many hills. But made it to Yalta. </p>
      <p align="left">05-28/29/30 <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Ukraine/gondola.html">Yalta</a> : very nice 
        city. I'll stay a few days. A problem this morning. My shoes were a bit 
        smelly so I put them outside by the window. In the morning, no shoes. 
        Had to buy a new pair. Trying to visit a school but school vacation starts 
        the day after tomorrow. Hey, their summer vacation is 13 weeks long !</p>
      <p align="left">05-31 Hey! I'm still in Yalta. Met some teachers this morning 
        at a school. Probably will go again tomorrow. Everyday I enjoy <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Ukraine/yaltabeach.html">swimming</a>. 
        Very nice city and cheap and people are friendly. I could live here. </p>
      <p align="left">06-01 Already June. But I'm on schedule. Visit a school 
        in the suburb of Yalta. Met the principal and have a talk with some students 
        (12th graders). Interesting. But tomorrow I'm moving on. By bus to Feodosia. 
        Only hills between here and there and not small.</p>
      <p align="left">06-02 I'm in Feodosia. Something is missing ......? The 
        sun. My last rainy day was in France. </p>
      <p align="left">06-03 Feodosia. The sun is back. Still a bit fresh but it's 
        only 8:00 AM. Yes 8:00 I got up early and it seems that this Internet 
        place is open 24/24. Back from Koktebel. The beaches aren't that good. 
        Overrated! Getting ready for the <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Ukraine/strelka.html">Arabatskaja 
        Strielka</a>. A 120km long sand spit just east of Crimea. So a 134 km 
        ride for tomorrow (Feodosia-Strelkovoe). Am I going to be able to do that 
        in 1 day? There is absolutely nothing on the way. Only wild nature with 
        the <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Ukraine/seaswamp.html">sea 
        on both side.</a></p>
      <p align="left">06-04 Written on 06-06 Back to the world of the Internet. 
        Made it! Made it!. Left at 6:00AM . That was a tough ride. When I said 
        not much that was true. Not even trees. Only grass. And what <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Ukraine/rest.html">a 
        road</a>! Sand and bumpy with light front wind. Did the 138 km in 11 hr. 
        Couldn't even stop for brakes. Too many flies and mosquitoes. Had to set 
        up the tent quickly at lunch time to shield me inside. More drinking water 
        would have been fine. So total 1413 km.</p>
      <p align="left">06-05 Not too tired. So did 113.3 km. Stopped about 25 km 
        before Melitopol. <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Ukraine/out.html">Camped</a>. 
        Didn't sleep much. Soaked again.</p>
      <p align="left">06-06 Did 113.2 km Hey! My average is going up. Find a cheap 
        room in Vasilivka. My right hand small finger is a bit numb.</p>
      <p align="left">06-07 Only 82 km today! Made it to Zaporizhzhya. Find only 
        an expensive hotel but need a good rest and a hot shower. They even charged 
        me for the parking of my vehicle (bike). But has TV with satellite channels 
        and the breakfast is buffet style. Visit of the <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Ukraine/cossack.html">Cossack 
        Museum</a> on Khortytsia Island. Today problem with two fingers !? Vibrations 
        of the bike ?!</p>
      <p align="left">06-08 Finally reach Dnepropetrovsk. Took the decision : 
        THE BIKE PART OF MY TRAVEL IS OVER. I have two friends here. A young Ukrainian 
        couple. They are helping me selling my bike. I'll stay a few days. They 
        are cyclists as well. I met them on the road about 2 weeks ago.<br>
        A few reasons for the switch :<br>
        1. Camping - Everywhere in Europe when I camp everything get completely 
        soak during the night. Humidity is maybe higher over here. And when the 
        sleeping bag is wet you freeze.<br>
        2. I thought that using a bike I would have the chance to meet more people 
        . Nada. Wrong.<br>
        3. Save money - Not much. When I have to put the bike in a bus or train 
        I have to pay extra here in Eastern Europe (In France it is free). In 
        hotels I have to pay extra to store the bike or use the parking !!<br>
        4. And what I mainly wanted to do by bike, France and Ukraine, is done.<br>
        5. And since 3 or 4 days I have a small problem with 2 fingers. Too much 
        vibrations? My average distance last week was over 100 km/day.</p>
      <p align="left">06-09/10 The bike is sold. Here in Eastern Europe you can 
        buy mountain bikes for cheap. Sold my $700 US bike for $200 . With that 
        money I buy a nice backpack. I give the tent &amp; sleeping bag and all 
        the accessories to my two friends. Final score: 1822 KM</p>
      <p align="left">06-11 <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Ukraine/Vladimir.html">Birthday 
        party</a> in the countryside. The family of my friends.</p>
      <p align="left">06-12 By train from now on. I'm in <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Ukraine/square.html">Kiev</a>. 
        Heavy rain since yesterday. And from now on it's going to rain almost 
        every other day until I take the TransSiberian from Moscow. Lucky I sold 
        the bike.</p>
      <p align="left">06-13 Kiev - The sun is back. Visited a looooot of <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Ukraine/church3.html">churches</a> 
        and the catacombs. Really special. </p>
      <p align="left">06-14/15 Lviv - Nice city. More <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Ukraine/3saints.html">churches</a>. 
        My last city in Ukraine. Leaving this evening by bus to Krakow (Poland).</p></td>
