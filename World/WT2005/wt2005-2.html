      <p align="left">05-07 Cheap ticket 110 Euro.. But Airport taxes 50 Euro 
        + taxi to the airport 45 Euro. Almost as much as the ticket to cross the 
        continent! People may ask me &quot;Hey you cycled from the airport to 
        Paris, why not the opposite.?&quot; There are no nice boxes waiting 
        for me at the airport to pack a bike and all the accessories. No way I 
        could carry those boxes on my head. I'm in Bulgaria. No problems at the 
        airport. But they wanted to see what was in that big box. Assembled the 
        bike (lot of curious people) and cycled to central Varna. You're not supposed 
        to cycle on that highway. In fact I did that a few times in Eastern Europe 
        without any problems. There are signs to make modern like in Western Europe 
        but they can't enforce it. They would have to stop all the peasants cycling 
        or on their carts pulled by donkeys, etc. It was dark when I arrived in 
        Varna. Hotels are more expensive than I expected. But it was already dark. 
        So took the second one.</p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000">05-08 <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Bulgaria/skeleton.html">Varna's 
        archaeological museum</a> is Bulgaria's best (I believe it). Over 100,000 
        pieces covering 6000 years of history. The beach is nice. But nobody's 
        swimming yet. Still cold.</font></p>
      <p align="left">05-09 Stayed 2 nights in Varna. Today took the train to 
        Plovdiv. The <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Bulgaria/plovdiv.html">roman 
        theater</a> is well preserved. More than the one in Orange (France). So 
        many tourists everywhere.<font color="#F40000" size="5"> </font></p>
      <p align="left">05-10 I'm in Sofia. No serious standout attractions apart 
        from the <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Bulgaria/nevski.html">cathedral</a>.<font color="#000000"> 
        Won't cycle much in Bulgaria. Airport to city. Train station to city or 
        within the city and the suburb. Except for the North near the border it's 
        too mountainous for my taste.</font></p>
      <p align="left">05-11 Train to Gorna Oryahovista. From there cycled about 
        25 km to <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Bulgaria/tarnovo2.html">Veliko Tarnovo</a>. What's there? 
        The mammoth <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Bulgaria/veliko.html">fortress</a> 
        and the medieval city, capital of the second Bulgarian Kingdom (1185-1393). 
        A site shared over the centuries by the Tracians, Romans and Byzantines. 
        The fortress was mainly built between the 5th and 12 centuries</p>
      <p align="left">05-12 Train to Ruse. That's before crossing the border to 
        Romania.</p>
      <p align="left">So what's my impression of Bulgaria and its people : A few 
        nice places to see but the people are not interested in where you're from, 
        where you're going, etc. Even if you're staying at their home for the 
        night. At least it wasn't so expensive. Cost : about half the price than 
        in Canada . Oh, I forgot to talk about the food. There are 2 kinds of 
        Bulgarian food. Traditional and pizza.</p>

      <p align="left">05-13 A great day. Woke up at 6:00AM. Was on the road at 
        7:00. Cycle the 15 km to the border. I got there before the custom opened 
        (8:00) . It's probably the first time they had someone crossing the border 
        on a bicycle. I guess that bridge is only for cars and trucks. People 
        on foot use the ferry or the train. At 8:30 I was in Romania after crossing 
        the long bridge over the Danube river. Cycled all the way up to Bucharest 
        on the highway (same comment as in Bulgaria). Nice weather. Hey there 
        is a Youth Hostel here. My luck. Because Romania is a bit expensive. About 
        the same price as in Canada. Visited the city. Great. You should see the 
        <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Romania/parliament.html">Palace 
        of Parliament</a>. The big mama of monstrous building as they say. I don't 
        find it that bad. To top all that a classical concert in the evening at 
        the <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Romania/philharmonic.html">Ateneul 
        Roman</a> by the George Enescu Philharmonic Orchestra. ^_^ Beethoven's 
        7th symphony. ^_^ Less than $8 Canadian (600 yen).</p>
      <p align="left">05-14 Laundry day. Went to the <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Romania/opera.html">Opera 
        Romana</a> and saw &quot;Rigoleta&quot; . 2h40 min. A bit long. But it 
        was great. About 40 actors/singers. Beautiful decor and costumes. A bit 
        less than $7 Cn (500 yen). And tomorrow there is the premiere of a ballet. 
        But it's sold out. Great country for arts.</p>
      <p align="left">05-15 Transylvania here I come. Train to <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Romania/sighi.html">Sighisoara</a>. 
        Nice citadel but not as impressive as I was expecting after reading the 
        guidebook. Back to <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Romania/piata.html">Brasov</a> 
        by bus. I'm going to stay here for the night. The guidebook says &quot;One 
        of the most visited city in Romania&quot;. Hum ... Took a few pictures. 
        Tomorrow is the day. I'm going to meet Dracula ....</p>
      <p align="left">05-16 <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Romania/dracula.html">Bran's 
        castle</a> is open only daytime and Dracula comes out only at night. How 
        can you meet him? The castle is worth a few pictures. Went to see <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Romania/rasnov.html">Rasnov's 
        castle</a> as well. Not much. I'm a bit disappointed by Romania. Train 
        back to Bucharest.</p>
      <p align="left">05-17 The border in the South between Romania and Ukraine 
        is not open. Must go North first to Kiev or go through Moldova. Got easily 
        my tourist visa for Moldova. Leaving by train to Chisinau (Moldova). </p>
      <p align="left">Romanian cuisine : not much and expensive but the wine is 
        good. The price of food at the grocery is about the same as in Canada. 
        If you're a fan of concert, opera and ballet and on a low budget Bucharest 
        is the place.</p>

      <p align="left">05-18 Arrived around 9:30AM in Chisinau. The first and second 
        hotel I went were full. The third had rooms. The price is OK but it's 
        just in front of the bus station and the <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Moldova/market.html">central 
        market</a>. A bit noisy but better than sleep on the street. I'll stay 
        here 3 nights. Laundry to do and rest. There are no &quot;must see&quot; 
        in this city. So, I'll try to study a bit more Russian.</p>
      <p align="left">05-19 Walked around town. Met <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Moldova/friends.html">some 
        students(4th grade) and their teacher</a>. Got an invitation for tomorrow 
        morning to visit their school (Petru Rares).</p>
      <p align="left">05-20 Had a talk with the 5th and 7th graders. Unfortunately, 
        they don't have grades 1 to 3 in this school. </p>
      <p align="left">05-21 WHAT A DAY! Got up at 5:20. The train for Odessa leaves 
        at 6:35 . Only $3 ! Not too many people so my bike won't be a problem. 
        But next station , WOW ! The train is overloaded with people and luggage. 
        I guess vegetable and clothes are cheaper in Moldova than Ukraine. But 
        not so bad. I've seen worst. Have you ever heard of a country named &quot;Transdniestr&quot;? 
        It's a self-declared republic inside Moldova. The train has to go through. 
        So first problem : For Moldova this country doesn't exist. So no exit 
        stamp in my passport. On the Transdniestr side they insist that I need 
        a stamp. They are asking me $150 at first. Now, I show them that I only 
        have $10 in my wallet. That's going to be enough. What a racket. None 
        of the Moldovians,Transdniestrians and Ukrainians need one. Now Ukrainian 
        border. What do you guess?<br>
