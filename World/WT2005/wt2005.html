      <p align="left">2004-09 Take the decision to do this tour. I want mainly 
        to see Eastern Europe before it changes too much. And who knows, maybe 
        even find an interesting job.</p>
      <p align="left">2004-10 Decide to do it by bike. For the challenge, save 
        money and meet people. Start to train at the gym.</p>    
      <p align="left">2004-11 Start to look for a travel/health insurance. Got 
        my plane reservation to Montreal. It's going to be April 1st</p>
  <p align="left">2004-12 Got an international ATM card for my travel. Tried it 
    in the Philippines during my Christmas vacation. Good</p>
      <p align="left">2005-01 Looking for a portable phone. Will buy it in Paris. 
        Will buy the bike in Montreal. Decide to cut : Spain, Portugal and Morocco 
        from my itinerary. Too much distance for 4 months.</p>
  <p align="left">2005-02 Eye test, health check, dental check. New glasses. Perfect. 
    Ready ...</p>
  <p align="left">2005-03 Travel health insurance. Moving out. A lot of recycling, 
    farewell parties, etc.</p>
      <p align="left">2005-03-31 Secure my new job for September when I come back.</p></td>

      <p align="left">2005-04-01 I'm at Narita Airport. Leaving to Montreal via 
        New York in 1 hour. </p>
      <p align="left">04-03 I'm in Montreal. Staying at a friend's house. Slept 
        14 hrs yesterday. Was really tired. Not much snow left. But cold rain.</p>
        
      <p align="left">04-07 Got my visa for Ukraine. Bought the bicycle and the accessories. Flying to Paris on April 12th.</p>
        
      <p align="left">04-08 Wow ! Bicycle and luggage 35 kg . There won't be a 
        live map on my blog. Too much work to update.</p>
        
      <p align="left">04-10 Did 60 km today ! <a href="TheBike.jpg">Great bike</a>. 
        I've never cycled more than 20 or 30 km in a day before. And first time 
        with luggage. The bike computer didn't work, one hook broke and forgot 
        my helmet home. But the main problem is when you're hungry or need to 
        go to the toilet. You must secure the bike and take all the luggage with 
        you.</p>

      <p align="left">04-13 I'm in Paris ^_^ Nothing missing. Nothing damaged. 
        Assemble the bike at the airport and cycle to Paris to my friend's house 
        near Le Moulin Rouge. Do a bit of shopping: cellphone, guidebooks, maps. 
        I'm going to follow the <a href="./TheWorld/Europe/France/channel.html">channels</a>. It's flat. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">04-15 Took the RER to Fontainbleau to get out of Paris. 
        A few shots of the <a href="./TheWorld/Europe/France/fontainebleau.html">castle</a> 
        and on the saddle to the French <a href="./TheWorld/Europe/France/meadow.html">countryside</a>. 
        Camped in Dordives. 4&deg;C . I'm the only one here at this time of the 
        year and by this weather. The camping owner was very nice. He gave me 
        a few maps and a lot of information. He used to cycle a lot. Couldn't 
        sleep. Too cold.</p>
      <p align="left">04-16 Sleep in a small hotel in Gien . The weather is really 
        bad. Cold and rainy. It's snowing in the North of France. Did 74 km today.</p>
      <p>04-17 Did only 20 km. I'm in Briare. Sunny but cold. The <a href="./TheWorld/Europe/France/briare.html">bridge</a> 
        is really special. Visited the museum.</p>
      <p>04-18 Did 77 km. A bit of rain. Slept at <a href="./TheWorld/Europe/France/chateau.html">Chateauvert</a>. 
        It's the name of a little castle NW of Nevers. Really really nice. Had 
        dinner with the castle owners.</p>
      <p>04-19 KM 298. I'm sleeping in Gannay-sur-Loire. Not so many Internet 
        caf&eacute;s in France ! And difficult to upload anything into the caf&eacute;'s 
        computers. </p>
      <p>04-20 KM 362. I'm in Digoin. Using the library's computer. From tomorrow 
        the weather should be better.</p>
      <p>04-21 Roanne. The Loire's lateral channel stops here. The reason : mountains 
        ahead. So I'm taking the train : Roanne-Lyon-Pierrelatte. Why Pierrelatte? 
        They don't accept bikes on trains going down to Orange or Avignon.</p>
      <p>04-22 Crossing a lot of vineyards. Visit the splendid <a href="./TheWorld/Europe/France/orange.html">Roman 
        theater</a> of Orange. When you are in <a href="./TheWorld/Europe/France/pape.html">Chateau-Neuf-du-Pape</a> 
        what do you do? Of course, taste wine. Passing in front of <a href="./TheWorld/Europe/France/villeneuve_lez_avignon.html">Villeneuve-lez-Avignon 
        castle</a>. Will come to see it tomorrow. Arrive in Avignon KM 500.2 Staying 
        here 2 nights . Laundry to do and rest my legs and a lot to see.</p>
      <p>04-23 So many things in Avignon. The magnificent <a href="./TheWorld/Europe/France/avignon.html">Pope's 
        palace</a> and the famous <a href="./TheWorld/Europe/France/pont.html">Pont 
        d'Avignon</a>.Visit Saint-<a href="./TheWorld/Europe/France/villeneuve.html">Andre's 
        fort</a> in Villeneuve-lez-Avignon as well. Didn't rest much my legs. 
        I like very much Avignon. </p>
      <p>04-24 Crossed the <a href="./TheWorld/Europe/France/guard.html">Pont 
        du Gard</a> on my bike. Down to Nimes. Not much except the <a href="./TheWorld/Europe/France/arena.html">Roman 
        forum</a>. Finished the day in Sommieres for the <a href="./TheWorld/Europe/France/good.html">medieval 
        weekend</a>. Great. Took a lot of pictures. The whole town and<a href="./TheWorld/Europe/France/prince.html"> 
        its peop</a>le look like a real medieval village. A lot of <a href="./TheWorld/Europe/France/archer.html">activities</a>. 
        It should be a year round festival. It's a pity I got there only in the 
        afternoon of the last day. I would have stayed longer.</p>
      <p>04-25 Noon. I'm in Montpellier. Had lunch and <a href="./TheWorld/Europe/France/yutaka.html">dinner 
        with Yutaka</a>. Bonjour Yutaka ! Merci pour la visite guid&eacute;e de 
        Montpellier. Hey! Sunny today. I think I'll be able to camp again from 
        tomorrow.</p>
      <p>04-26/27/28 I'm in Cap d'Agde. Staying here 3 nights. The beach is superb 
        and clean. But the water is still a bit cold. Yeh! I'm finally using my 
        tent (used it only once after I left Paris). But not perfect. I'm near 
        the sea, so around 4 o'clock I woke up completely soaked and a bit cold. 
        The fog usually clears up around 8.</p>
      <p>04-29 KM 770 Camping near Beziers. Did 87 Km today ! I'm following the 
        &quot;Canal du Midi&quot;.</p>
      <p>04-30 Staying in Carcassonne today. The <a href="./TheWorld/Europe/France/carcassonne.html">medieval 
        fort</a> is huge and awesome. Lot of laundry to do.</p>
      <p>05-01 May 1st. All shops in the little villages I'm crossing are closed.</p>
      <p>05-02 I'm in Bordeaux. I was planning to go to the beach for a few days 
        but the weather will be really bad for the next 3 or 4 days. Visited the 
        <a href="./TheWorld/Europe/France/bordeauxcat.html">cathedral</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>05-03 KM 941 Visited <a href="./TheWorld/Europe/France/plumereau.html">Tours 
        </a>and took the train to Paris.</p>
      <p>05-04 Shopping for a plane ticket to Eastern Europe and <a href="./TheWorld/Europe/France/me_ndame.html">wander 
        around Paris</a>. The destination will depend on the price. Can be Bulgaria, 
        Romania or even Istanbul (Turkey).</p>
      <p>05-05 Found a cheap ticket Paris-Varna (Bulgaria). Only 110 Euro and it's 
        a return ticket. Hum! I don't need the return.</p>
      <p>So, three weeks in France. On schedule. Covered almost a <a href="./TheWorld/Europe/France/francemap.html">thousand 
        kilometers</a> on my bike and about the same by train. The highlights 
        : Avignon, Cap d'Agde, Sommi&egrave;res and Carcassonne.</p>
      <p>If I had a year I would have done the whole tour (of France) by bike. 
        But I must be back in Japan mid-August and still have a lonnnng way to 
        go. Had seen the Loire Valley before so jumped that part. Had to use hotels 
        instead of camping. So spent a lot more there but payed a lot less than 
        expected for the plane ticket. France was mainly my training ground before 
        Eastern Europe. France was a piece of cake compared to what's coming.</p>
