Really tired. I'm going to sleep a few hours before visiting the         city... . <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Poland/place.html">Rynek Glowny Square</a> is a nice place         to hangout. I like this city. </p>      <p align="left">06-17 Warsaw. Only 3 hrs by express train. Got 1 hr too         soon at the train station (Krakow). After 24 hrs in Poland I just noticed         that Poland has 1 hr difference with the rest of Eastern Europe. Fake         Old Town. Everything was rebuilt after WWII. Not much to see. Just checked         the cultural events. Not much. Umh..... I should have stayed an extra         day in Krakow. Moving to Lithuania tomorrow morning.</p>      <p align="left"><font color="#FF0000" size="5">Lithuania <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Lithuania/lithuania.html"><img src="lith-flag.jpg" border="0"></a></font></p>      <p align="left">06-18 Vilnius(Lithuania). Warsaw-Vilnius 10 hrs by train.         I'm staying at the Youth Hostel. </p>      <p align="left">06-19 <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Lithuania/vilnius.html">Vilnius</a> - Small but nice         city. Laundry &amp; cooking. Yes cooking ! At YHs you can cook. And in         this one you can bring your wine. Went to see Star Wars III. When I'l         go back to Japan I have to watch them all from 1 to 6.</p>      <p align="left">06-20 Vilnius - The Chinese consulate here asks for a letter         of invitation to get a visa. So, I'll get it in Finland or Russia. Wow!         $150 US for the Russian visa with the letter of invitation. I'll get it         tomorrow afternoon. Hair cut. Cooked a nice trout. About $1 + Wine + Camembert</p>      <p align="left">06-21 Vilnius - Got my visa for Russia. Went to see &quot;Batman         begins&quot;</p>      <p align="left"><font color="#FF0000" size="5">Latvia <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Latvia/latvia.html"><img src="lat-flag.jpg" width="45" height="22" border="0"></a></font></p>      <p align="left">06-22 Train to Riga (Latvia). Nice little old town and luckily         there was a <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Latvia/riga3.html">festival</a>         today. Lot of smiling people dancing and playing music. Very colourful.</p>      <p align="left"><font color="#FF0000" size="5">Estonia <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Estonia/estonia.html"><img src="est-flag.jpg" width="45" height="28" border="0"></a></font></p>      <p align="left">06-23 Bus to <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Estonia/tallinn.html">Tallinn</a>(Estonia)         - It's a holiday. Eeeeverything is closed. A few pictures.</p>      <p align="left"><font color="#FF0000" size="5">Finland <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Finland/finland.html"><img src="fin-flag.jpg" width="45" height="27" border="0"></a></font></p>      <p align="left">06-24 Ferry to Helsinki (Finland). Nice cruise. Wow! Finland         is really expensive. And it's a holiday here too. All the Finnish are         out of town for at least 3 days. Only tourists here. Shops, markets, bars         &amp; cafes are closed. Only one market is open. The one under the central         train station. Wander across the city.</p>      <p align="left">06-25 Helsinki - Only one place where I've found Finnish         people. At the amusement park. And it's a nice one. Stay a few hours there.         Buy my train ticket for St-Petersburg.</p>      <p align="left"><font color="#FF0000" size="5">Russia <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Russia/russia.html"><img src="rus-flag.jpg" width="45" height="30" border="0"></a></font></p>      <p align="left">06-26 St-Petersburg No problems getting into Russia. I'm         at the YH. Found a Kodak shop to transfer my pictures on a CD.</p>      <p align="left">06-27 St-Petersburg - I'm not taking my Chinese visa here.         Same problem as in Vilnius, plus the delay is a full week. Visit the city.         Nice buildings. No main cultural events today or tomorrow. </p>      <p align="left">06-28 St-Petersburg - The <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Russia/hermitage.html">Hermitage         museum</a> is huge and in the same class as The Louvre or the British         Museum. Take a loooot of pictures. Don't miss them. You could spend days         and weeks here if you want to see everything.</p>      <p align="left">06-29 Moscow - Night train. Went to the Chinese embassy.         Bureaucracy. They open from 9:00 to 12:00. They let enter one person every         15~20 minutes. In the guide book they say to get there at 7:00 and if         there are already more than 20 people in front of you, forget about getting         in. I believe it. So, no China and Mongolia for this trip. I'm taking         the train to Vladivostok with a day stop in Irkutz.</p>      <p align="left">06-30 Moscow under the rain - Visited <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Russia/kremlin_01.html">Red         Square</a> and everything around. Ate at the famous <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Russia/macdo.html">McDonald</a>.         When it opened in 1990 it was an expensive restaurant for the average         Russian. Now it's one of the cheap joints in town. Got a good job offer         from a friend in Japan for the summer. So after Vladivostok I'll be crossing         to Japan and the loop will be closed for the World Tour 2005.</p>      <p align="left">07-01 Moscow - Last day - Visited a few places in the <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Russia/convent2.html">suburb</a>.       </p>      <p align="left">07-02/04 TransSiberian Train - Enjoying the ride. Play chess         a lot. Listen music on my iPod. Every stop the train does everyone rushes         out to be first at the different stalls to buy food or drinks or just         to stretch. Or you can buy the <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Russia/lunch.html">train's         meal</a>. Not bad.</p>      <p align="center"><a href="TranssibMap.gif"><img src="TranssibMap_s.gif" width="676" height="362" border="0"></a></p>      <p align="left">07-05 Irkutsk - A nice shower and a nice bed.</p>      <p align="left">07-06/09 In the train again. THIS is the famous <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Russia/baikal.html">Baikal         lake</a>! Click! Met a <a href="../TheWorld/Europe/Russia/katcha.html">nice         Russian family</a> in the train. It's a pity we couldn't communicate much.       </p>      <p align="left">07-09 Vladivostok - Finally ! The ferry I wanted to take         this evening to Japan is full. The next one is in 2 weeks. The ferry to         Korea is in a week. Monday's plane to Niigata is full. Everyone is going         to Japan for the Expo in Nagoya. And not much to see here and Russia is         really expensive. So, I'm flying tomorrow to Seoul (Korea) from where         it is easy to go back home (Japan).</p>      <p align="left">07-10 Made it to Seoul (Korea)! - Good to be out of Russia.         I'm going out now shopping for a plane ticket for Japan for tomorrow.         No! They aren't open on Sundays.</p>      <p align="left">07-11 Seoul - Got my ticket to Tokyo. I'll be in Japan this         evening. Sushi tomorrow ^_^</p>      <p align="left">07-12 Tokyo - I confirm : EARTH IS ROUND .</p>      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>      <p align="left">The highlights : Going down the French channels especially         the Canal du Midi and stopping for lunch to eat p&acirc;t&eacute;, cheese         &amp; bread and delicious pastries. Wine in the evening. Further down         the road going to the concert, ballet &amp; opera. The nice cities of         Yalta and St-Petersburg. Without forgetting the strielka. And finally         the long trip on the TransSiberian train.</p>      <p align="left">For the ones who asked me &quot;Where are the most beautiful         women in the world?&quot; Now I can answer that they are in Ukraine. If         you like the superwoman type.</p>      <p align="left">On the road from Romania to Irkutsk I met 5 times the same         Canadian guy by coincidence. World can be small sometimes.</p>      <p align="left">The main problems: </p>      <p align="left">- The bad weather in France.</p>      <p align="left">- Not being able to get the visa for China and so not visiting         Mongolia. </p>      <p align="left">- My problem with two fingers. They took about two months         to fully recuperate.</p>      <p align="left">What about the bicycle idea? It was my first trip by bike.         I did it but I wouldn't do it again. At least I wouldn't carry the weight         of a tent &amp; a sleeping bag and all the accessories. No flat tires.         A great bike.</p>      <p align="left">The most useful piece of equipment : the iPod to store the         pictures &amp; to listen to music.</p>      <p align="left">Where would I go again? : Cap d'Agde, Sommi&egrave;res (during         the Medieval Festival), Bucharest &amp; Odessa for the concerts, opera         &amp; ballet (really cheap &amp; of great quality), Yalta, visit my friends         in Ukraine, Riga during the festival, and finally the nice city of St-Petersbourg.       </p>      <p align="left">Thing I should have prepared better before departure : Study         Russian.</p>      <p align="left">Took over 4000 pictures and a few short videos. Kept about         1200 of them on a first screening. 649 on the final. The 222 best ones         are here on my web site.</p>      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>      </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
